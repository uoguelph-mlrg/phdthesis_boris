# About

Author: [Boris Knyazev](http://bknyaz.github.io/)

These LaTeX sources were used by Boris Knyazev to compile a [pdf of his PhD thesis](Knyazev_Boris_202203_PhD.pdf). The format of the resulted pdf was close enough to the recommended format of the University of Guelph (see official recommendations [here](https://graduatestudies.uoguelph.ca/current-students/preparation-your-thesis)). The published thesis is available at https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/xmlui/handle/10214/26824.

## Important notes

- This format is largely borrowed from [Brendan Duke's Master's thesis](https://github.com/dukebw/master-thesis-fusion) and [Terrance DeVries's PhD thesis](https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/xmlui/handle/10214/26570).
- To satisfy editorial requirements I had to make some adjustments to the above templates without clearly understanding LaTeX, so the final sources are likely to be full of bad coding practice.
- The sources only compiled on overleaf and there were mysterious errors when compiling it locally.
- There are a lot of redundant figure files in folders `figs` that I was lazy to filter out before uploading.
